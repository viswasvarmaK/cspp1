    Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.
    The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that
    each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid
    contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

    Complete the check_sudoku function to check if the given grid
    satisfies all the sudoku rules given in the statement above.
